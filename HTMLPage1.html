    <p><h1>Computer Engineering Role in COVID-19 Pandemic?</h1></p>
    <p>
        Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.

        Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans

    <p> vaccines prevent severe COVID-19 infection and death. so, Everyone should get vaccinated and encourage others to get vaccinated according to each country’s vaccination plan and recommended age limit for the vaccine. However, because there is not enough vaccine available early on, there is a prioritization scheme so that persons who need it the most can get the vaccine first.</p>

    COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.

    Most common symptoms:

    fever.
    dry cough.
    tiredness.
    Less common symptoms:

    aches and pains.
    sore throat.
    diarrhoea.
    conjunctivitis.
    headache.
    loss of taste or smell.
    a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes.
    Serious symptoms:

    difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.
    chest pain or pressure.
    loss of speech or movement.
    Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms.  Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility.

    People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.

    On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.

    <p><h2><big>How can computer science contribute to stop the COVID-19 pandemic?</big></h2></p>
    <p>
        The question of how computers can contribute to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic is being posed to experts in artificial intelligence (AI) all over the world.
        AI tools can help in many different ways. They are being used to predict the spread of the coronavirus, map its genetic evolution as it transmits from human to human, speed up diagnosis, and in the development of potential treatments, while also helping policymakers cope with related issues, such as the impact on transport, food supplies and travel.
        But in all these cases, AI is only effective if it has sufficient examples to learn from. As COVID-19 has taken the world into unchartered territory, the "deep learning" systems, which computers use to acquire new capabilities, don’t necessarily have the data they need to produce useful outputs

    A range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable.

    The restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread.

    Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are "the" exit strategy from the pandemic.
